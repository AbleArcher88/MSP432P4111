# msp432p4111-pac

A peripheral access crate for the MSP432P4111, generated using svd2rust.
Very much a WIP.

Currently Three examples are planned:
* [ Blink a LED (completed, see led_blinker.rs) ]
* [ Use an interrupt (In progress, see interrupt.rs) ]
* [ Use the LCD screen (will be done in the future) ]

* [ Eventually, a HAL will be written. ]
